1. What is the difference between memstore and hfile in HBase
The main reason for using Memstore is the need to store data on DFS ordered by row key. As HDFS is designed for sequential reads/writes, with no file modifications allowed, HBase cannot efficiently write data to disk as it is being received: 
the written data will not be sorted (when the input is not sorted) which means not optimized for future retrieval.


2. Describe compactions in HBase.
3. List and explain the logical entities in HBase.
4. What will happen if we do not create a row key while inserting the data?
5. How can filters be applied in HBase and what are the benefits?
6. What are the data model operations in hBase?
7. How can MapReduce be used with HBase?
8. What is regionserver?
